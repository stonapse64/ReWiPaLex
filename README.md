# ReWiPaLex
Repository of wisdom and painful lessons with Python, Jupyter, Linux and Windows.

## Introduction
This is a collection of learnings that I made during my learning journey with data science and machine learning during 2024. I consider myself a beginner in these fields and the learning curve was and still is steep, mostly joyful but sometimes joyful and painful at the same time.

My learning journey consists of three main courses plus a good dozen of books and some papers here and there:
1. [fast.ai: Practical Deep Learning for Coders](https://course.fast.ai/)
2. [fast.ai: Practical Deep Learning for Coders part 2: From Deep Learning Foundations to Stable Diffusion](https://course.fast.ai/Lessons/part2.html)
3. [Hugging Face: Deep Reinforcement Learning Course](https://huggingface.co/learn/deep-rl-course/unit0/introduction)

Over some weeks I came up with some stable procedures to set up my three machines (@work, @coding, @GPU) on Windows 10 and 11 for data science and machine learning projects REPRODUCIBLY.

To cut it short: I write this notebook to not forget the learnings and to have a hands-on guide.
