# ReWiPaLex
Repository of wisdom and painful lessons with Python, Jupyter and Windows.

## Introduction
This is a collection of learnings that I made during my learning journey with data science and machine learning during 2024. I consider myself a beginner in these fields and the learning curve was sometimes steep and joyful and painful at the same time.

Over some weeks I came up with some stable procedures to set up my three machines (@work, @coding, @GPU) on Windows 10 and 11 for data science and machine learning projects REPRODUCIBLY.

To cut it short: I write this notebook to not forget the learnings and to have a hands-on guide.
