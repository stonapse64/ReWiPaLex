    "\n",
    "I really had a hard time to figure out how I can best reproduce a virtual environment across machines. I tried to use a requirement.txt with `python -m pip freeze > requirements.txt` but I failed due to exceptions being raised although in theory this should not happen (???).\n",
    "\n",
    "Another thing that I noticed is that each edit and execution of a Jupyter notebook has its own \"dynamic\" meaning you start to pip install required libraries as you code and experiment. Then, the later me doesn't remember what it did like two hours or two days ago and the mess starts to grow especially across different machines.\n",
    "\n",
    "I came up with a couple of approaches to solve this issue:\n",
    "- Use only one machine for a given project. Don't try to fetch and work on it here and there. If you absolutely need to, follow the recommendations of the next list items.\n",
    "- Do the pip installs only from code cells of your Jupyter notebook as bash commands using the syntax `! pip install NameOfLibrary` and never delete these cells. This way you have a protocol of your installs. See the [pip documentation](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/) for further arguments other than the name of the library.\n",
    "- Do these pip installs in the cell or the cell before where you needed a library first and comment on your decision to install it. This way you know why you installed a library.\n",
    "- After the initial installation replace the pip command with `! pip install -Uqq NameOfLibrary`. This way the installation is updated to the latest version every time you run the notebook / that cell. If you have dependencies and absolutely need a specific version use the syntax `pip install package==version`.\n",
